Jot Android App

I made this app to expirement with android programming.  With it you can create jots
 and add them to square-tile UI.  Jot is either a picture or a text box with the color of your choosing.  It also 
lets you share the Jot to any of the sharing outlets your android phone has set up.  Also has a datestamp
when the Jot was made, and orders them in order of date added.
